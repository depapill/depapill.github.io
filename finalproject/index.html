      <p>Since the start of the United States back in 1776, New York has been a staple of some of the strongest states in the nation. Something that's also stayed constant is New York's political party. Since 1984, the Empire State has consistently leaned one way: towards the Democratic party. The 2024 election that recently passed was one of the most controversial in history, between vice president Kamala Harris of the Democrats and former President and convicted felon Donald Trump for the Republicans. Trump and his party focused a significant amount of their campaign on New York, which begs the question: how realistic is seeing a state so rooted in democracy flip its political affiliation?</p>

      <p>The 2024 election cycle saw Republican candidate Donald Trump focus a lot of attention on his home state of New York. Trump rallied in the South Bronx back in May amidst his hush money trial, where he pushed for minority voters in the state. Closer to the election in September, Trump hosted a rally at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, located on Long Island, where there is a large Republican affiliation. At that event is where the words that sparked this conversation came when Trump exclaimed “We are going to win New York.” The biggest stamping point came about a week before the election when Trump landed a rally at Madison Square Garden in midtown Manhattan, known by many as “the World’s Most Famous Arena.” The former president lost his home state by around 23 percentage points during the 2016 and 2020 elections, yet there was so much done by the campaign to swing voters. The two main questions that stem from that are: 1. Did it work? 2. How does this push affect future elections? Well, let’s dive into the numbers.</p>

            <p> As you can see, there has been a consistent and drastic shift in the number of counties each election cycle going toward the Republicans. In the inaugural election for Trump in 2016, he only took home 11 of the 62 counties. Come 2024, Trump won 46 of them over Kamala Harris. A shift this large is unprecedented, and draws concern from the Democratic party about a possible red swing. A similar trend is being seen in neighboring states New Jersey and Connecticut, but many are skeptical about whether this trend is a political party shift or just a candidate-caused idea. Because we’re only seeing this swing in the Trump era of U.S. politics, what would happen if it were a different Republican candidate? Below is a chart of the New York wins in presidential elections by margin, which will show how the win percentage has shifted in the past 30 years, which is certainly closer and closer more recently. </p>

              <p>Not only is this a political question, but it’s more of a cultural question, especially with the image of Donald Trump. I spoke to Edward A. Panetta, one of the heads of counter-terrorism in New York City for the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) who was coordinating the protection for president-elect Trump during his rallies in New York mentioned earlier.</p>


              <p>“It was actually unbelievable,” Panetta said about the Madison Square Garden turnout. “Being anywhere near that event was simply chaos, especially in midtown Manhattan. I’ve worked New Year’s Eve ball drops, championship parades, and so much more, but this was the craziest following I’ve ever seen in one place. New York gravitates to that man.”</p>
              
              
              <p>So to answer the essential question of this piece, I feel like we can’t say without seeing another candidate take the helm of the Republican party. Trump is one of the largest populists this nation has ever seen and carries an audience and a following better than some candidates have ever done. The data does show a swing towards turning red, but the Trump presidency has been so polarizing in every sense of the word that it’s simply too soon to tell.</p>
